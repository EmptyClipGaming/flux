# Flux

A minecraft modpack crafting platform, build once integrate everywhere. The end goal is to be able to
construct a modpack in a simple way, and then publish to hosting platforms, such as Feed the Beast,
and TechnicLauncher.

Current State: Planning

# Integrations

* TechnicLauncher (Alpha)
* Feed the Beast (Beta)

If you know of a pack downloading platform that you would like to see added to this list, just add an issue.

# Why

Creating a modpack for your friends can be an annoying process at the worst of times, and a tedious one
at the best of times. There exist ways to do it, but they require a decent amount of setup that a normal user
probably isn't capable of doing, it also takes some resources for hosting, and the bandwidth of downloads.

I seek a future where you simply pick and choose a list of mods, uploading the files you need that aren't there,
and then cherry picking them into a modpack, with the ability to setup your configs and versions, then going to
Technic or FTB and pushing a button to consume what you've built, then you send an email to all of your friends
with a link to download the modpack, and get in the game.
